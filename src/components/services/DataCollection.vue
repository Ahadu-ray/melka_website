        JaRco is strategically positioned with years of experience collecting data in Africa, often
        in a context where information is difficult to obtain. We engage in quantitative and
        qualitative data collection to support development and humanitarian programming and
        interventions for the well-being of individuals and communities, with particular focus on
        the most vulnerable. We apply a pragmatic and evidence-based approach to ensure that our
        clients can utilize our findings and make positive impacts in their respective fields.
